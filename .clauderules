# MARNEXII Pitch Deck Project Rules

## Critical Validation Rule: Visible Changes Must Match Code Changes

**Every change that affects what the user sees MUST be validated before considering the work complete.**

### When This Rule Applies:
- Changing slide headings, titles, or any displayed text
- Updating taglines, descriptions, or messaging
- Modifying navigation titles or labels
- Any content that appears in the UI

### Required Validation Steps:

1. **Identify ALL locations** where the content appears:
   - Search the codebase for the exact text being changed
   - Check both navigation/metadata AND actual rendered components
   - Example: Slide titles appear in BOTH `app/page.tsx` (navigation) AND in the slide component itself (e.g., `components/slides/solution-slide.tsx`)

2. **Update ALL locations** that need to match:
   - Don't assume updating one location updates all locations
   - Each component file is independent
   - Navigation titles and slide headings are separate

3. **Verify the change** before marking complete:
   - Read back the affected files to confirm changes were applied
   - Check that both visible text AND any metadata match
   - If uncertain, explicitly ask the user to confirm they see the change

### Examples of This Rule in Action:

**❌ INCORRECT:**
- User asks to change slide 5 title to include "Sea, and Subsea"
- Update only `app/page.tsx` navigation title
- Assume it's complete without checking the actual slide component

**✅ CORRECT:**
- User asks to change slide 5 title to include "Sea, and Subsea"
- Search for the current text "A Living Digital Twin of Ports and Ships"
- Find it appears in BOTH:
  - `app/page.tsx` line 25 (navigation title)
  - `components/slides/solution-slide.tsx` line 71 (actual heading)
- Update BOTH locations
- Read back both files to verify changes applied

### Validation Checklist Before Committing:
- [ ] Searched codebase for all instances of the text being changed
- [ ] Updated all locations where the content appears
- [ ] Verified changes by reading back the affected files
- [ ] Considered navigation titles, slide headings, and any other metadata
- [ ] If the change involves capitalization, grammar, or punctuation, reviewed it carefully
- [ ] **READ THE SENTENCE OUT LOUD** - Does it make grammatical and semantic sense?
- [ ] Applied basic reasoning - Does this change make sense in context?

## Additional Rules:

### Capitalization
- Always capitalize the first word of a sentence
- Review capitalization when making text edits

### Deployment
- NEVER offer to build the project
- User will handle deployment via `./scripts/deploy_marnexii.sh --letsgo --noci`

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format
- Include clear description of what changed
- Always include Claude Code attribution
