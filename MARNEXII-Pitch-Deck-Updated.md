# MARNEXII - Investor Pitch Deck (Vision Edition)

---

## 1. Title - Mission-Critical Maritime AI

**Purpose:** Instantly conveys gravity, domain, and ambition.

**Slide Copy:**

> **MARNEXII**
> *Mission-critical, maritime AI.*
> A sensing, predictive decision-making, and control layer.

**Visual Direction:**

* Cinematic port-at-dusk visual with subtle radar/data overlays.
* High contrast, black and ocean blue palette.
* Minimal logo lockup center screen.

**Implementation Notes:**
* Title "MARNEXII" is prominent but balanced
* "Mission-critical, maritime AI." is emphasized as the main tagline
* Tagline "A sensing, predictive decision-making, and control layer." uses whitespace-nowrap to prevent breaking "decision-making"

## 2. Problem - The Oceans Run on Blind Spots

**Purpose:** Show the magnitude of inefficiency and lack of visibility.

**Slide Copy:**

> 90% of global trade moves by sea, and will always do so.
> Yet most ports operate on lagging, incomplete, or manually *"written on scratch-pad"* data.
> Operators and regulators make decisions hours or days late.
> They're managing the world's most complex logistics network - blindfolded.

**Visual Direction:**

* Wide aerial of a congested port at sunset.
* Faded scribbles of handwritten notes blending into chaotic data feeds.
* Text overlay: *"Blind spots cost billions."*

**Implementation Notes:**
* Added "and will always do so" to emphasize permanence of maritime trade
* "written on scratch-pad" is in quotes and italicized to emphasize the archaic nature

## 3. The Shift - AI is Only as Good as the Data It Sees

**Purpose:** Highlight why maritime AI hasn't worked - yet.

**Slide Copy:**

> AI can't predict what it can't perceive.
> Maritime systems lack continuous, high-fidelity ground truth.
> Marnexii is rebuilding that foundation - from the edge up.

**Visual Direction:**
Split screen - left: noisy AIS feed; right: crisp fused overlay (AIS + weather + camera).

**Implementation Notes:**
* Black backdrop behind text ensures readability against busy background images
* Split-screen comparison shows the transformation from noisy to clean data

## 4. Solution - A Living Digital Twin of Ports and Ships

**Purpose:** Introduce Marnexii as the inevitable platform layer.

**Slide Copy:**

> Marnexii turns real-world sensor signals into a unified maritime AI.
> It serves as a sensing, predictive decision-making, and control layer.
> From dock operations to fleet movements and global surveillance -
> one real-time view of the global maritime waterways.

**Visual Direction:**
3D render (or cinematic still) of a port with data overlays: radar sweeps, route vectors, weather cells.

**Implementation Notes:**
* Expanded scope to include "global surveillance"
* Emphasized "one real-time view of the global maritime waterways" as the unified vision

## 5. Why Now - Maritime's Anduril Moment

**Purpose:** Frame the timing advantage.

**Slide Copy:**

> Global trade strains, emissions rules, and AI-native infrastructure are converging.
> Hardware costs are down, edge compute is up.
> Ports are becoming networks, not facilities.
> The next decade of shipping will be defined by who controls the data layer.

**Timeline Events:**
* **2021:** Ever Given blocks the Suez Canal - halts $9B/day in trade
* **2022:** Russia invades Ukraine - global sanctions reshape commodities
* **2023:** Red Sea attacks and rerouted vessels - new chokepoints emerge
* **2024:** Baltimore bridge collapse - disrupts critical U.S. port traffic

**Additional Context:**

> Data is an evergreen part of the AI process. Big model makers are mostly set (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, etc), but they will always need new data to train and ground their models on.

**Visual Direction:**
Timeline of inflection points with specific events showing maritime disruptions and the need for real-time intelligence.

**Implementation Notes:**
* Added specific timeline events with years to ground the "why now" narrative
* Added data evergreen concept to emphasize long-term value proposition
* Positioned as secondary insight after the Anduril Moment framing

## 6. Product Demo

**Purpose:** Prove credibility and real-world adoption with live demonstration.

**Slide Copy:**

> **Product Demo**
>
> Pilots and partnerships with major operators:
>
> * McAllister Towing
> * HelmCONNECT
>
> Integration partnerships with **HelmCONNECT**.
>
> Active builds at **Fort Maons** (personally in San Francisco until Nov 8th for Founders Inc Blueprint).
>
> Live ingestion, analytics, and visualization prototypes **deployed**.

**Live Product Video:**
* Video link: https://x.com/tobieapb/status/1977169350428934267
* Note: The visualization shown is an internal monitoring tool developed by MARNEXII to see what the system is currently perceiving, not the final product interface.

**Visual Direction:**
* Prominent "Product Demo" title centered at top
* Video preview with clickable play button overlay
* Map showing vessel tracking with detailed information panel

**Implementation Notes:**
* Changed from "Already Trusted by the Operators Who Move the World" to "Product Demo" for clarity
* Removed Moran Towing, Ultratug, and BiehlCo from partner list
* Added video demonstration with clear note about internal vs. product interface
* Video preview includes hover effects to signal interactivity

## 7. Product - The System That Sees Everything

**Purpose:** Ground the story in tangible software proof.

**Slide Copy:**

> Live edge receivers. Real data. Real-time dashboards.
> Marnexii Station Dashboard, Vessel Map Viewer, Metrics System.
> Not mockups - operational prototypes already in use.
>
> Geospatial awareness and capability to deploy cameras and drones allow detection of non-radio and non-vessel objects in the waterways.

**Visual Direction:**
Dark cinematic background, glowing white UI elements.
Rotating composition of dashboards and map viewer.

**Implementation Notes:**
* Added geospatial awareness capability to emphasize comprehensive monitoring
* Highlights ability to detect objects beyond traditional AIS/radio signals

## 8. Market - A Trillion-Dollar System, Slowed by Billion-Dollar Inefficiencies

**Purpose:** Anchor market size in tangible economics.

**Slide Copy:**

> Every hour a vessel waits at berth costs operators thousands in demurrage.
> In a single large port, delays can exceed **$5-10 million per day**.
> Across global trade, inefficiencies exceed **$100 B annually** - before emissions or throughput losses.
>
> Marnexii targets the invisible layer beneath that: the data and decision infrastructure determining how ships move and ports breathe.
>
> By fusing real-time signals into predictive control, we unlock value across every maritime operation - from docking to dispatch, terminal management, port operations, and offshore law enforcement monitoring (unsanctioned fuel transfers, illicit rendezvous).

**Visual Direction:**
Side-by-side: *"1 vessel idle = $75K/day"* overlayed on photo of waiting ships; zoom-out showing *"Global demurrage > $100B/year."*

**Implementation Notes:**
* Changed "every port operation" to "every maritime operation" to reflect broader scope
* Expanded use cases to include terminal management, port operations, and offshore law enforcement
* Added specific examples: unsanctioned fuel transfers and illicit rendezvous

## 9. Business Model - From Signals to Systems

**Purpose:** Show defensibility and compounding value.

**Slide Copy:**

> **Tier 1 - Signals:** Continuous edge data from our receivers and integrations. Licensed as a data feed or subscription API.
> **Tier 2 - Predictive Modules:** Real-time analytics and anomaly detection designed to plug into HelmCONNECT, ERPs, or port systems.
> **Tier 3 - AI Control Layer:** Fleet- and port-level decision intelligence, powering scheduling, routing, and automation.
>
> Each layer compounds - the more signals we own, the smarter every connected system becomes.

**Visual Direction:**
